    "In the [supervisor notebook](langgraph_multi_agent_supervisor.ipynb), we built a single supervisor managing multiple agents. But what happens when your system grows to 8, 10, or 15 agents? A single supervisor becomes a bottleneck — it has too many agents to manage and too much context to track.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution: **hierarchical teams** — teams of teams, where each sub-team has its own supervisor, and a top-level orchestrator coordinates between sub-teams.\n",

    "- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates both teams and synthesizes a final investment report\n",

    "- **Subgraph composition** — compile a graph, then use it as a node in a parent graph\n",
    "- **State mapping** — translate between parent and child state schemas\n",
    "- **Layered supervision** — each level manages its own scope"

    "\n",
    "| Factor | Flat (Single Supervisor) | Hierarchical (Teams) |\n",
    "|--------|-------------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| Number of agents | 2-5 | 6+ |\n",
    "| Domain diversity | Similar domains | **Distinct specializations** |\n",
    "| Context window pressure | Low | **Reduces per-supervisor context** |\n",
    "| Development complexity | Simple | More complex |\n",
    "| Debugging | Easy to trace | Requires per-team inspection |\n",
    "| Scalability | Limited | **Highly scalable** |\n",
    "| State isolation | Shared everything | **Scoped per team** |\n",
    "| Reusability | Low | **Sub-teams are independently testable** |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Architectural Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State boundaries matter** — Sub-teams should have their own state type. Don't leak internal state to the parent.\n",
    "2. **Test sub-teams independently** — Each sub-team is a compiled graph that can be invoked and tested on its own.\n",
    "3. **State mapping is the glue** — The wrapper functions that translate between parent and child state are the critical integration points.\n",
    "4. **Summaries, not transcripts** — Pass team summaries to the parent, not raw message history. This keeps the orchestrator's context clean.\n",
    "5. **Two levels is usually enough** — Going deeper than 2 levels of hierarchy adds complexity without proportional benefit.\n",
    "\n",
