    "## What is CrewAI?\n",
    "\n",
    "**CrewAI** is a role-based multi-agent orchestration framework that makes it easy to build teams of AI agents that collaborate to accomplish complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept | Description |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Agent** | An autonomous unit with a specific role, goal, and backstory. Each agent can use tools and an LLM to reason and act. |\n",
    "| **Task** | A unit of work with a description and expected output, assigned to an agent. |\n",
    "| **Crew** | A team of agents working together on a collection of tasks. |\n",
    "| **Process** | The execution strategy — Sequential (tasks run in order) or Hierarchical (a manager delegates). |\n",
    "| **Tools** | Functions that agents can call to interact with the outside world (search, scrape, calculate, etc.). |\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks through building progressively more complex agent systems with CrewAI, using OpenAI as the LLM provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**: Familiarity with Python, LLM APIs, and basic prompt engineering."

    "### When to Use CrewAI\n",
    "\n",
    "CrewAI is an excellent choice when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You want to model your system as a **team of specialists** with distinct roles\n",
    "- You need **rapid prototyping** — going from idea to working multi-agent system in minutes\n",
    "- Your workflow maps naturally to **delegation patterns** (researcher → analyst → writer)\n",
    "- You want **less boilerplate** than lower-level frameworks\n",
    "- You need built-in support for **sequential and hierarchical** execution\n",
    "\n",
    "### CrewAI vs LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dimension | CrewAI | LangGraph |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|-----------|\n",
    "| **Abstraction level** | High — role-based agents | Low — state machines and graphs |\n",
    "| **Mental model** | Team of people with roles | Graph of nodes and edges |\n",
    "| **Speed to prototype** | Very fast | Slower (more setup) |\n",
    "| **Fine-grained control** | Limited | Full control over state and transitions |\n",
    "| **Execution patterns** | Sequential, Hierarchical | Any graph topology (cycles, branches, etc.) |\n",
    "| **Tool integration** | Built-in tool ecosystem | Manual tool binding |\n",
    "| **Debugging** | Agent-level logs | State-level inspection |\n",
    "| **Best for** | Role-based teams, content pipelines, rapid prototyping | Complex state machines, conditional logic, production systems |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Start with CrewAI** if you want to get a multi-agent system running quickly and your workflow is role-based.\n",
    "- **Move to LangGraph** when you need precise control over execution flow, complex branching, or custom state management.\n",
    "- Both frameworks can use the same underlying LLMs and many of the same tools — the choice is about **orchestration philosophy**, not capability."
